# Simple Modal Control

This JavaScript code manages a modal on a webpage. It toggles the visibility of the modal and overlay when triggered by clicking specific buttons. Additionally, it allows closing the modal by clicking on the overlay or pressing the 'Escape' key. The code uses event listeners for button clicks and keydown events to achieve this functionality.
